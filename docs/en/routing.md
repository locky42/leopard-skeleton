# Routing

Routing is a mechanism that allows HTTP requests to be directed to the appropriate controllers and methods in your application. In Leopard Skeleton, routing supports several approaches:

1. **Attribute-based Routing**: Using PHP attributes `#[Route]` to define routes directly in the code.
2. **YAML-based Routing**: Defining routes in YAML files for configuration convenience.
3. **Dynamic Routing**: Routes that can change depending on parameters or conditions.

Each of these approaches has its advantages and is used depending on the project's needs.

3. [Dynamic Routing](dynamic-routing.md)
